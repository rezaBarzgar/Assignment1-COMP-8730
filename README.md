This assignment is about solving the misspelled correction problem using [Levenshtein algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).
Given a dictionary and a corpus of misspelled words alongside the corresponding correct spelling,
calculate the minimum editing distance (MED) of each misspelled token
against the tokens of the dictionary and check if the correct
spelling exists in the K least distant words which are retrieved from the dictionary. The output of this assignment is the average occurrence of the correct word in the set of the top K least distant words.
